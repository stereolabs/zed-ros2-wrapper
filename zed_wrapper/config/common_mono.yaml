            pub_resolution: "NATIVE" # The resolution used for output. 'NATIVE' to use the same `general.grab_resolution` - `CUSTOM` to apply the `general.pub_downscale_factor` downscale factory to reduce bandwidth in transmission

        video:

            auto_whitebalance: true # [DYNAMIC]
            whitebalance_temperature: 42 # [DYNAMIC] - [28,65] x100 - works only if `auto_whitebalance` is false
            auto_exposure: true # [DYNAMIC] - Enables or disables auto exposure control. false: manual, true: auto
            exposure_time: 16000 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the real exposure time in microseconds. Recommended to control manual exposure (instead of `video.exposure` setting)          
            auto_exposure_time_range_min: 28 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the minimum range of exposure auto control in micro seconds
            auto_exposure_time_range_max: 30000 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the maximum range of exposure auto control in micro seconds
            exposure_compensation: 50 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the Exposure-target compensation made after auto exposure. Reduces the overall illumination target by factor of F-stops. Values range is [0 - 100]. Default value is 50, i.e. no compensation applied
            auto_analog_gain: true # [DYNAMIC] - Enables or disables auto gain control. false: manual, true: auto
            analog_gain: 1255 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the real analog gain (sensor) in mDB. Range [1000-16000]. Recommended to control manual sensor gain (instead of `video.gain` setting)
            auto_analog_gain_range_min: 1000 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the minimum range of sensor gain in automatic control
            auto_analog_gain_range_max: 16000 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the maximum range of sensor gain in automatic control
            auto_digital_gain: false # [DYNAMIC] - Enables or disables auto digital gain control. false: manual, true: auto
            digital_gain: 1 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the real digital gain (ISP) as a factor. Range [1-256]. Recommended to control manual ISP gain (instead of `video.gain` setting)
            auto_digital_gain_range_min: 1 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the minimum range of digital ISP gain in automatic control
            auto_digital_gain_range_max: 256 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the maximum range of digital ISP gain in automatic control
            denoising: 50 # [DYNAMIC] - Defines the level of denoising applied on both left and right images. Range [0-100]

        sensors:
            publish_imu_tf: true # [usually overwritten by launch file] enable/disable the IMU TF broadcasting
            sensors_pub_rate: 200. # [DYNAMIC] - frequency of publishing of sensors data. MAX: 400. - MIN: grab rate

        stream_server:
            stream_enabled: false # enable the streaming server when the camera is open
            codec: 'H264' # different encoding types for image streaming: 'H264', 'H265'
            port: 30000 # Port used for streaming. Port must be an even number. Any odd number will be rejected.
            bitrate: 12500 # [1000 - 60000] Streaming bitrate (in Kbits/s) used for streaming. See https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/api/structsl_1_1StreamingParameters.html#a873ba9440e3e9786eb1476a3bfa536d0
            gop_size: -1 # [max 256] The GOP size determines the maximum distance between IDR/I-frames. Very high GOP size will result in slightly more efficient compression, especially on static scenes. But latency will increase.
            adaptative_bitrate: false # Bitrate will be adjusted depending the number of packet dropped during streaming. If activated, the bitrate can vary between [bitrate/4, bitrate].
            chunk_size: 16084 # [1024 - 65000] Stream buffers are divided into X number of chunks where each chunk is chunk_size bytes long. You can lower chunk_size value if network generates a lot of packet lost: this will generates more chunk for a single image, but each chunk sent will be lighter to avoid inside-chunk corruption. Increasing this value can decrease latency.
            target_framerate: 0 # Framerate for the streaming output. This framerate must be below or equal to the camera framerate. Allowed framerates are 15, 30, 60 or 100 if possible. Any other values will be discarded and camera FPS will be taken.
