            gop_size: -1 # [max 256] The GOP size determines the maximum distance between IDR/I-frames. Very high GOP size will result in slightly more efficient compression, especially on static scenes. But latency will increase.
            adaptative_bitrate: false # Bitrate will be adjusted depending the number of packet dropped during streaming. If activated, the bitrate can vary between [bitrate/4, bitrate].
            chunk_size: 16084 # [1024 - 65000] Stream buffers are divided into X number of chunks where each chunk is chunk_size bytes long. You can lower chunk_size value if network generates a lot of packet lost: this will generates more chunk for a single image, but each chunk sent will be lighter to avoid inside-chunk corruption. Increasing this value can decrease latency.
            target_framerate: 0 # Framerate for the streaming output. This framerate must be below or equal to the camera framerate. Allowed framerates are 15, 30, 60 or 100 if possible. Any other values will be discarded and camera FPS will be taken.
